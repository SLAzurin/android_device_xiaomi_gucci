Hmmmm…Correction: After Flash MoKee ROM,you must Resize System Partition because System Space will be change and insufficient space after Flash MoKee ROM and you can’t install gapps or some apps to system.

Go to Wipe -> Advanced Wipe -> Check √ System -> Partition Options -> Resize FS -> Swipe to Resize (if failed do it again).
